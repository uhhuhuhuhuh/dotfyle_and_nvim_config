# my neovim config
This is my very minimul config with no ui clutter.\
However it does requires fzf, and ripgrep(rg) \
(also if you want a solid/opaque background delete lines 25-28 in lua/plugins/eyecandy.lua)

## Installation
Use powershell if you are using windows
```
git clone https://github.com/uhhuhuhuhuh/neovimConfig ~/.config/nvim
# use %userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim instead of ~/.config/nvim if you use windows
rm ~/.config/nvim/lazy-lock.json
# use %userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\lazy-lock.json instead if you use windows
nvim # load it up and have fun :)
```
